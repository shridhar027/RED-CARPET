# RED-CARPET
project for hackathon


This project is an Event Management platform designed to help users seamlessly organize their special events. Users can add details about their family events—such as weddings, birthday parties, corporate functions, and more—and connect with professional event workers offering services like photography, decoration, entertainment (DJ), catering, and more.

Features:
User Event Creation: Users can easily add event details (type, date, location, etc.).
Professional Workers: Event professionals (photographers, decorators, caterers, DJs) can browse event listings and offer tailored deals to users.
Best Deals: Workers can directly contact the users with competitive pricing and service offers.
Easy Communication: Smooth, direct communication between users and service providers.
This platform allows users to efficiently arrange their events and ensures event professionals get the exposure and opportunities to connect with clients in need of their services.
